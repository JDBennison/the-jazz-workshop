                <h2>Practical workshops/ensembles</h2>
                <p class="fw-bold">Overview</p>
                <p>Practical workshops run as ensembles and are limited to 7 people. There is usually one space for a bassist and drummer
                in each group and up to 2 spaces for piano, guitar and front-line instruments (including saxophone, trumpet, clarinet,
                flute, trombone and other instruments).</p>
                <p>There are several ensembles available and they are curated so as to ensure you are playing with people of a similar
                level. During the term, we explore a range of repertoire, styles and improvisation methods, and end the term with a gig
                where each band performs a set.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Who Can Join</p>
                <p>The ensembles are suited to you if you have a degree of technical proficiency on your instrument. We take up to advanced
                players and place everyone in appropriate groups. It is possible to join with very limited knowledge of jazz harmony and
                theory but if this is the case, you might be encouraged to attend the theory course! Usually, participants have done a
                little jazz but are at the stage of wanting to play more with other people and get to grips with improvisation.</p>
                <p>If you are completely new to your instrument, the ensembles won’t be suitable for you. We advise that you start your
                musical journey with some 1-1 tuition to get you to a level where you can play in time with other people. Talk to us for
                more info.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">When?</p>
                <p>The ensembles run for approximately 10 weeks per term, usually mid-week in the evening.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Where?</p>
                <p>Currently, all courses take place at <a href="https://www.underthebridgemusic.org/" target="_blank" class="link-secondary">Under The Bridge Studios</a> in Brighton</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">How much?</p>
                <p>The practical workshop costs £200 per person, per term. This includes all resources, tuition and the end-of-term
                performance opportunity. Concessions may be available for students or depending on your financial situation.</p>

                <h2>Theory Courses</h2>
                <p>The theory course is a 2-part course, each part providing 3 hours of tuition. It covers the essential components of jazz
                harmony and theory, with the goal of making lead sheets and scored jazz music more comprehensible and helping you to get
                to grips with the language and terminology around this genre of music. It covers scale and mode theory, understanding
                chord symbols and extensions, tune analysis and more.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Who Can Join</p>
                <p>The prerequisite for this course is that you have a basic understanding/awareness of general music theory, i.e. key
                signatures, circle of 5ths, major and minor scales. If you’re not sure if it’s right for you, just ask!</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">When?</p>
                <p>This varies per term but usually it’s held on a Saturday morning.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Where?</p>
                <p>Currently, all courses take place at <a href="https://www.underthebridgemusic.org/" target="_blank"

                <h2>1-1 Tuition</h2>
                <p>1-1 tuition is great way to get professional guidance that is tailored to your stage of learning.</p>
                <p>As well as running The Jazz Workshop, Arabella teaches saxophone to an advanced level, having studied at Birmingham

                <p>If you’d like instrumental lessons for any other instrument, we can connect you to tutors for bass, drums, flute,
                clarinet, piano and guitar. We are fortunate in the South East of England to have incredible professional musicians who
